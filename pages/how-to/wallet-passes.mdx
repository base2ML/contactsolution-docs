## Troubleshooting

### Pass Won't Add

**Apple Wallet:**
- Ensure you're on iOS 15 or later
- Check that Wallet is enabled in Settings
- Try using Safari instead of another browser

**Google Wallet:**
- Update Google Play Services
- Ensure Google Wallet app is installed
- Check internet connection

### Pass Not Updating

1. Remove the pass from your wallet
2. Re-add it from your dashboard
3. Wait 5 minutes for changes to sync

### QR Code Not Scanning

- Increase screen brightness
- Clean your phone screen
- Ensure the QR code is displayed at full size

## Pass Design

Your wallet pass includes:
- **Front:** Profile photo, name, title, company
- **Back:** Full contact details, social links
- **QR Code:** Links directly to your full card

## Privacy Considerations

- Wallet passes don't share data when displayed
- QR code only shares your public card URL
- You control what information appears on your card
