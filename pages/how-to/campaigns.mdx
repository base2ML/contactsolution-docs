## What Are Attribution Campaigns?

Attribution campaigns let you create unique, trackable QR codes for different marketing materials and placements. Instead of using one generic QR code everywhere, create specific codes for each placement to see exactly what's working.

**Example:** A real estate agent creates a campaign for "123 Main St Listing" with separate QR codes for:
- Yard sign
- Flyer box
- Open house sign-in
- Mailer postcard

Now they can see which placement brings the most interested buyers.

## Adding Placements

After creating a campaign, add placements for each unique QR code location:

1. Open your campaign
2. Click **Add Placement**
3. Configure the placement:
   - **Label** - Where the QR code will be placed (e.g., "Yard Sign", "Bus Shelter A")
   - **Destination URL** - Where to redirect after scan
   - **Category** - Optional grouping (e.g., "outdoor", "indoor", "print")

### Intermediary Page Options

For each placement, you can toggle an intermediary landing page:

- **Show Intermediary Page** - Display a landing page before redirecting
- **Attach Contact Card** - Show your digital business card on the landing page
- **Custom CTA Text** - Personalize the continue button (default: "Continue")
- **Auto-redirect Delay** - Optional countdown (0-10 seconds, 0 = click only)

<Callout type="info">
  Intermediary pages are great for high-value placements where you want to capture attention and show your contact information before visitors continue to their destination.
</Callout>

## Downloading QR Codes

For each placement, you can download the QR code in multiple formats:

1. Open the placement
2. Click **Download QR**
3. Choose size and format:
   - **PNG** - Best for digital use
   - **SVG** - Best for print (scalable)
   - **Size** - 400px to 1000px

<Callout type="tip">
  For print materials, use SVG format at the highest resolution. This ensures your QR codes look crisp at any size.
