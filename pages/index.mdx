## Core Concepts

### Placements
A **placement** is any marketing touchpoint you want to track—a yard sign, flyer, booth banner, email signature, or product packaging. Each placement gets a unique QR code so you know exactly which one drove the engagement.

### Campaigns
Group related placements into **campaigns**. For example, a "Spring Trade Show" campaign might include placements for your booth banner, handout flyer, and badge QR. Compare performance across placements to see what works.

### Engagement
When someone scans your QR code, you see the **engagement**. Free tier shows total counts. Pro tier shows when they scanned, what device they used, and where they were.

## Use Cases

### Real Estate
Track yard signs, listing flyers, and open house materials. Know which sign locations drive the most scans.
