## Attribution Campaigns for Events

Use attribution campaigns to track which event materials drive the most engagement.

### Pre-Event Setup

**Create Your Event Campaign:**
1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Campaigns**
2. Click **"New Campaign"**
3. Name it (e.g., "Tech Conference 2026")
4. Add placements for each touchpoint

**Typical Event Placements:**

| Placement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Banner Stand** | Large display at your booth |
| **Table Tent** | Small cards on tables |
| **Badge Insert** | Included in attendee packets |
| **Handout Flyer** | Distributed materials |
| **Business Card** | Your personal card with tracking |
| **Presentation Slide** | QR code in your deck |

### During the Event

**At Your Booth:**
- Display QR codes prominently
- Enable intermediary pages to show your contact card
- Track which placement drives scans in real-time

**For Speakers:**
1. Add campaign QR to final presentation slide
2. Use a unique placement name ("Keynote QR")
3. Track engagement from your talk

**For Exhibitors:**
- Create unique placements for different booth locations
- Compare left-side banner vs right-side banner performance
- See when scans peak (during demos, after talks, etc.)

### Post-Event Analysis

**Pro Analytics Show:**
- Total scans per placement
- Time distribution (which sessions drove traffic)
- Device breakdown (mobile vs desktop)
- Geographic data (useful for multi-location events)

<Callout type="tip">
  Badge inserts often have the highest follow-through rate because attendees scan them after returning to their office.

## Intermediary Landing Pages

Enable intermediary pages to capture attention before redirecting:

### For Speaking Engagements
- Display your card after presentation
- Give audience time to save your contact
- Custom CTA: "Download Slides" or "Connect"

<Callout type="info">
  Intermediary pages work on all tiers. They're especially powerful at events where you want visitors to see your full contact card before heading to your website.
