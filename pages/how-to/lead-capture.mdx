# Lead Capture Forms

Turn your digital card into a lead generation machine with built-in contact forms.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  Lead capture is available on all tiers. Email notifications are included free, and webhook automations require **Pro** tier.
</Callout>

## What Are Lead Capture Forms?

When someone views your card, they can submit a contact form to reach out to you. This creates a **lead** that you can manage, track, and follow up on.

### Benefits

- **Never miss a connection** - Get notified instantly when someone wants to connect
- **Capture context** - See what message they sent and what card they found you through
- **Track everything** - Monitor lead status from new → contacted → converted
- **Automate follow-ups** - Trigger webhooks to Zapier, HubSpot, Slack, and more

## How It Works

1. Visitor scans your QR code or clicks your card link
2. They view your card and click "Contact Me"
3. They fill out the form (name, email, optional phone/message)
4. You receive an instant email notification
5. Lead appears in your dashboard for follow-up
6. (Pro) Webhooks fire to your connected apps

## Setting Up Lead Capture

### Enable the Contact Form

Lead capture is enabled by default on all cards. To verify:

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **My Cards**
2. Click on a card to edit
3. Scroll to **Contact Settings**
4. Ensure "Enable Contact Form" is toggled on

### Customize the Form

You can customize what information visitors can submit:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Yes | Always required |
| **Email** | Yes | For follow-up contact |
| **Phone** | Optional | Toggle in settings |
| **Company** | Optional | Useful for B2B |
| **Message** | Optional | Let them explain why they're reaching out |

## Managing Leads

### Viewing Your Leads

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Leads**
2. See all leads across all your cards
3. Filter by status: New, Contacted, Converted, Archived

### Lead Status Workflow

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **New** | Just captured, needs attention |
| **Contacted** | You've reached out |
| **Converted** | Successful connection or deal |
| **Archived** | No longer active |

### Taking Action on Leads

For each lead, you can:

- **View details** - See full submission including message
- **Update status** - Move through your pipeline
- **Add notes** - Record follow-up details
- **Delete** - Remove unwanted leads

## Email Notifications

When someone submits a contact form, you'll receive an email with:

- Lead's name and contact info
- Which card they contacted you through
- Their message (if provided)
- Direct link to the lead in your dashboard
