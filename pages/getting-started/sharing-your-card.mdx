## Sharing vs Placement Tracking

| Method | Use Case | Analytics |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Direct Card Sharing** | Quick contact exchange | Basic view counts |
| **Campaign Placements** | Marketing attribution | Full engagement analytics |

For marketing attribution (yard signs, flyers, event materials), use Campaign placements to get detailed analytics on when, where, and how people engage.
